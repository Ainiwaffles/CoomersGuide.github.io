Quick, basic testing. May not be accurate in all cases.

Note that these can be combined: `Writing style: narrative, whimsical, quirky` etc.

Also note that all of these have only been tested in lowercase, and capitalizing the word changes the token which may in some cases change how the AI understands the word.

 
## Recommended for use:

* `narrative`: Increase in narrative content. Longer paragraphs with deeper descriptions.
* `verbose`: Strong effect. Shifts the story focus towards dialogue, but also slightly increases the overall detail.
* `oratorical`: Tends to turn dialogue into monologues.
* `talkative`: Strong effect. Increase in the amount of dialogue, with focus on small-talk.
* `conversational`: Similar to the above, makes everyone chatty.
* `detailed`: Increases the level of detail for descriptions, but can be a bit dry. If used, should usually be combined with one of the more vivid styles.
* `witty`: Tries to be witty, but isn't very good at it. Still a slight improvement.
* `melancholic`: Dark, depressing, bordering on grimdark.
* `energetic`: Similar to 'fast-paced', but this has action-movie feel to it. Might be useful.
* `frenetic`: Even more frenzied than 'fast-paced'. Probably too overwhelming for most scenarios. ``The ground shakes as you hear the barricade ahead shatter under the pressure of dozens of werewolves trying to smash through the door.``
* `exciting`: Anime references and a lot of shouting.
* `tense`: Dramatic, action-movie style.
* `euphoric`: Adds positive mood to the output. Much more elaborate and mature compared to 'happy' style.
* `educational`: Strong effect. Dry text, like reading school book.
* `philosophical`: Strong effect, very out-of-character in some cases.
* `wry`: Sarcastic dialogue, works more reliably than 'sarcastic'.
* `upbeat`: Strong effect, party-time.
* `dramatic`: Feels more like action-drama than emotional drama.
* `light-hearted`: Moderate effect, heavy good-defeats-evil focus.
* `ominous`: Strong effect. Foreboding events and dialogue, works especially well combined with 'narrative'.
* `aggressive`: Notable increase in aggression and violence.
* `bitter`: Crude, angry dialogue. Teen angst. Not the world-weary type of bitterness.
* `suspenseful`: Moderate effect. Basically thriller-movie style.
* `uplifting`: Strong effect. Dialogue straight out of motivational posters.
* `loving`: Strong effect. Very sappy and romantic.
* `romantic`: Slightly less sappy.
* `sardonic`: Moderate effect. More snarky than sardonic, but works.
* `festive`: Strong effect. A lot of holiday references, will be useful for Christmas scenarios.
* `awful`: Decreases output quality, even adds spelling errors... Maybe useful for joke scenarios?
* `gloomy`: Gloomy mood with a dash of whiny and depressive dialogue.
* `cool`: Literally makes the characters act 'cool', could be useful for some scenarios.
* `scary`: Strong effect. Focus on tension instead of outright horror.
* `creepy`: Strong effect. Now we're in the horror-territory.
* `film-noir`: Strong effect. Fatalism, dingy realism, corruption, and long inner monologues. Tends to make the protagonist male, regardless of what you put in Remember etc.
* `grim`: Strong effect. Impossible odds, grim situations. In one sample output the protagonist was fighting a horde of demons in Hell, with opening line of 'There's no two ways about it, you're dead.'
* `playful`: Strong effect. Whimsical and boisterous, with theatrical tones. Nonsensical at times, reminds me of Gulliver's Travels.
* `anomalous`: Mild effect. Adds eerie overtones, might be useful for horror-scenarios.
* `blasphemous`: Strong effect. Demonic magic, cults, etc. Nice for eldritch horror type of scenarios.
* `exploration`: Strong effect. Has nice dungeon delving mood to it, with overtones of mystery. Vivid descriptions for wilderness and abandoned places (anything from dungeons to old houses).
* `cryptic`: Mysteries abound, works much better than 'mysterious'.
* `dirge`: Strong effect. Vividly dark mood. Grim, but not completely depressing.
* `whimsical`: Commonly used style, but I still can't pinpoint exactly what it does. It seems to make things more... creative, with positive mood (reduces amount of violence, situations can usually be solved by talking, etc.)
* `quirky`: Makes output weirder. Strange events, strange characters. Good for some scenarios, but can be illogical at times.
* `surreal`: Stronger version of the above.
* `zany`: Yet another variant that makes the output more sarcastic/comedic. These have slight tone-differences; this one seems to make the narrator especially snarky.
* `chaotic`: Strong effect. Makes things zany, especially dialogue. Compared to 'surreal', this is more random.
* `esoteric`: Philosophical and spiritual focus, increased usage of obscure words. Combines especially well with styles such as 'narrative' and 'philosophical'.
* `introspective`: Decreases the amount of dialogue by making the protagonist think more.
* `pensive`: Similar to 'introspective': makes the protagonist think more. Gets very descriptive with their motivations. 
* `parody`: Mostly puns. AI is not good at humor, but it tries hard with this style.
* `reverie`: Similar to 'whimsical', with purple prose and lucid dream feel to it.
* `sonnet`: Doesn't usually follow the exact sonnet structure, but often turns the output into poetry.
* `list`: With this, the AI is more likely to stick to a list-format in the output. Useful for list-generator scenarios.
* `macabre`: Grim and grisly. Generated mostly occult horror, with frequent apocalyptic themes (zombies, undead hordes, etc.)
* `tragic`: Heavy focus on loss, heroic sacrifices and other similar themes. If there's victory to be had, it'll likely be bittersweet.
* `gritty`: Violent style, with a lot of cursing and increased amount of gore.
* `highbrow`: Intellectual style, with a bit of pretentiousness to it. Sometimes works well, sometimes lapses into pseudo-intellectual. And sometimes... "The sun's rays filter through the clouds like gold dust, slowly at first, then more rapidly, like a child caught in the act of some naughtiness. They catch the last few snowflakes, reflecting brightly off of them as they dance madly from one corner of the sky to another, as if performing an elaborate interpretive dance of "Ode to Joy" by Beethoven."
* `bildungsroman`: This genre is about the growth of the protagonist, which is hard to test fully. But as far as style goes, it seems to make output feel more protagonist-focused, though it often lapses into third person. "Zack had a feeling, an intuition that today was going to be a great day. He couldn't explain it, but he felt optimistic about his future. The sky was bright and blue with just a few fluffy clouds, the air was warm, and the breeze carried the scent of the sea toward him. He sniffed the air, just catching the hint of salt. He knew it was silly, but he loved the smell of the ocean."
* `tall tale`: Varied style, but generally makes it sound like someone's telling an exaggerated story, often starting with 'Once upon a time', continuing with occasional injected '...anyway', 'Where was I?' and frequent fantastical elements. Can get very silly.
* `exaggerated`: Exaggerated to the max. `The beach was the most amazing place in the history of existence. Any person with any sense would know that. The sand was like a billion tiny little fireworks exploding beneath your feet. The water was so clear you could see all the way to Hawaii.`
* `magic realism`: Highly nuanced. Sometimes inserts fantasy elements to the story, but mainly it adds certain 'sense of wonder' into the output. "The shadows call to you. The shadows in the deep. Shadows of lives not lived, of memories lost and hopes abandoned."
* `purple prose`: Too elaborate. But listing it anyway for the sake of completeness. It might be possible to combine this with other styles to balance it a bit. "A sunbeam tumbled from the heavens and onto a daisy, where it bathed the petals in a golden light. A bee, drunk on this heavenly ambrosia, staggered from the pistil of the flower into the sky. The sky itself was a robin's egg blue, uncontaminated by even a single cloud. The waves roared as they crashed upon the shore like baby seals. Bright green seaweed danced in their wake like an Irish jig."
* `caveman`: Caveman-style dialogue, and simple descriptions. `Go beach! Day go sunny! Surf good! Bears no eat you! You go beach now?`
* `primitive`: Almost identical to 'caveman'. Can be combined with it for stronger effect.
* `realistic`: Seems to keep the output grounded, though this is rather hard to test.
* `allegory`: Not very strong, but when it works the AI is surprisingly good at allegorical writing. `Zack walked towards the water, a giant, ground shaking beast. The surf was his forest, his home. Inside it, he was king.`
* `sesquipedalian`: Want the AI to use longer (and often more obscure) words? Use this. Note that combining this one with other styles makes it much weaker.  `The surf was both epidermic and epipleural, incrustating the auric essence of the cerulean waves. The brine-born bromide of the marina diffused in the atmosphere, condensing in the rubescent clouds, from which issued a mellifluous rain, dampening the zealous sands, begetting a plethora of verdant growth, a viridian veneer which would quell the scintillation of the sun.`
* `sophomoric`: Casual and somewhat crude style. `Zack and the boys were down at the beach, trying to get a tan and score chicks. The waves were hot as hell and the chicks weren't exactly models.`
* `grave`: Gravitas. Makes the tone more serious, gives the output more weight and dignity.
text adventure: The interactive fiction style (Zork etc.) Strongly first-person and present tense. Increases the amount of environmental descriptions, but feels a bit disjointed.

## Genres (these do not have much effect on the style, but instead impact the 'genre' and focus of the story):

* `medical`: Strong effect, adds medical terminology and focus to the output. Can be combined with styles such as 'quirky' for weird science. `You have a rare congenital defect that makes you unable to store glycogen in your liver, as such your body metabolizes it immediately after consumption.`
* `scientific`: Not much effect on its own, mostly just injects lab equipment (petri dishes, etc.) into the story. Stronger effect when combined with 'medical', but tends to veer into science fiction.
* `rustic`: Shifted the story focus to farming, village/rural life, that kind of things. Good for Harvest Moon style of scenarios.
* `military`: Strong effect, military fiction focus with heavy slant towards land-battles.
* `pirate`: Strong effect, makes everything pirate-focused.
* `fantastic`: Adds fantasy-elements to the story. Might be useful for keeping fantasy-scenarios on-track.
* `arcane`: Almost skipped testing this, but turns out it works. Heavily focus on magic, useful for keeping fantasy scenarios on-track.
* `investigative`: Heavy focus on detective-fiction style of narrative. Combines well with 'film-noir'.
* `grandiose`: Shifts the story focus towards high society, and makes the story more epic than usual. On the downside, this often inserts the Emperor, which then usually veers the story into WH40K territory.
* `light-hearted`: Strong good-defeats-evil focus.
* `tragic`: Heavy focus on loss, heroic sacrifices and other similar themes. If there's victory to be had, it'll likely be bittersweet.
* `Greek tragedy`: Bronze age adventures, with frequent references to Zeus, titans, etc. Does good job at pruning out modern technology, and tends to generate vivid output.

## Not recommended:

* `fast-paced`: Makes dialogue short, maybe too fast-paced.
* `amusing`: Barely noticeable, compared to 'quirky' and 'whimsical'.
* `emotive`: Strong effect, over-emotional. Tends to side-track stories.
* `confident`: Mild effect, works better as per-character trait.
* `emotional`: Mild effect, barely noticeable. 'emotive' worked better.
* `dry`: 'Dr. Doom'-style dialogue, somewhat sarcastic. Better suited for character personality traits.
* `epic`: Rarely works; Hollywood overload when it works. 'Energetic' tends to work better.
* `capricious`: Slight effect. Impulsive dialogue, works better as character trait.
* `menacing`: Weak effect. Increase in angry dialogue. Works better as character trait.
* `warm`: Mild effect. Increase in positivity... and warm weather.
* `religious`: Strong effect. Works, and does what you'd expect. Better suited for character traits.
* `egocentric`: Makes everyone egoists. Better to just use 'egoist' in character traits.
* `exhausting`: Whiny, negative dialogue. I don't see much use for this.
* `altruistic`: Heroic dialogue and actions. Better suited for character traits.
* `ambivalent`: Makes characters indecisive. Useless.
* `showy`: Makes everyone act like braggarts. Better suited for character traits.
* `epitaph`: Sometimes generates actual epitaphs, but more often than not it simply outputs 'THE END'. 'Dirge' works much better.
* `melodramatic`: Another one that works better as character traits. Using it as a style makes the output very...whiny.
* `plain-speak`: Makes sentences shorter and simpler. Might have some very marginal uses.
* `mad`: Makes the protagonist slightly insane... and everyone else too. No effect on style. Another character-trait candidate.
* `expository`: Nobody can keep secrets, and characters tend to say aloud what they're about to do. Narration focuses on past events. This doesn't seem particularly useful, though maybe it'd have some uses in lore-generation (if you reduce talkativeness by combining this with something like 'introspective'.)
* `descriptive`: Describes the locations and characters in detail, but sounds mechanical at times (like old-school interactive fiction). I'd recommend 'narrative' instead.
* `absurd`: Makes things weirder, but 'quirky' and 'surreal' had more consistent effect.
* `assertive`: No effect on the style, but makes every character confident. This is better suited for personality traits.
* `stylish`: Makes the characters wear fancy clothing, etc. No effect on writing style. Might have niche usefulness if you're making a fashion-focused scenario...

## SFW-focused:

* `happy`: Simple, childish dialogue.

## NSFW-focused:

* `sensual`: Tends to be rather explicit, not really what I'd call 'sensual'.
* `seductive`: Strong effect, makes most characters flirty. Better used as character-trait.
* `arousing`: Heavily NSFW. Makes the scenes more... descriptive.
