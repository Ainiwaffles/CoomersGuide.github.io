Quick, basic testing. May not be accurate in all cases.

Note that these can be combined: `Writing style: narrative, whimsical, quirky` etc.

Also note that all of these have only been tested in lowercase, and capitalizing the word changes the token which may in some cases change how the AI understands the word.

 
## Recommended for use:

* `narrative`: Increase in narrative content. Longer paragraphs with deeper descriptions.
* `verbose`: Strong effect. Shifts the story focus towards dialogue, but also slightly increases the overall detail.
* `oratorical`: Tends to turn dialogue into monologues.
* `talkative`: Strong effect. Increase in the amount of dialogue, with focus on small-talk.
* `conversational`: Similar to the above, makes everyone chatty.
* `detailed`: Increases the level of detail for descriptions, but can be a bit dry. If used, should usually be combined with one of the more vivid styles.
* `witty`: Tries to be witty, but isn't very good at it. Still a slight improvement.
* `melancholic`: Dark, depressing, bordering on grimdark.
* `energetic`: Similar to 'fast-paced', but this has action-movie feel to it. Might be useful.
* `frenetic`: Even more frenzied than 'fast-paced'. Probably too overwhelming for most scenarios. ``The ground shakes as you hear the barricade ahead shatter under the pressure of dozens of werewolves trying to smash through the door.``
* `exciting`: Anime references and a lot of shouting.
* `tense`: Dramatic, action-movie style.
* `euphoric`: Adds positive mood to the output. Much more elaborate and mature compared to 'happy' style.
* `educational`: Strong effect. Dry text, like reading school book.
* `philosophical`: Strong effect, very out-of-character in some cases.
* `wry`: Sarcastic dialogue, works more reliably than 'sarcastic'.
* `upbeat`: Strong effect, party-time.
* `dramatic`: Feels more like action-drama than emotional drama.
* `light-hearted`: Moderate effect, heavy good-defeats-evil focus.
* `ominous`: Strong effect. Foreboding events and dialogue, works especially well combined with 'narrative'.
* `aggressive`: Notable increase in aggression and violence.
* `bitter`: Crude, angry dialogue. Teen angst. Not the world-weary type of bitterness.
* `suspenseful`: Moderate effect. Basically thriller-movie style.
* `uplifting`: Strong effect. Dialogue straight out of motivational posters.
* `loving`: Strong effect. Very sappy and romantic.
* `romantic`: Slightly less sappy.
* `sardonic`: Moderate effect. More snarky than sardonic, but works.
* `festive`: Strong effect. A lot of holiday references, will be useful for Christmas scenarios.
* `awful`: Decreases output quality, even adds spelling errors... Maybe useful for joke scenarios?
* `gloomy`: Gloomy mood with a dash of whiny and depressive dialogue.
* `cool`: Literally makes the characters act 'cool', could be useful for some scenarios.
* `scary`: Strong effect. Focus on tension instead of outright horror.
* `creepy`: Strong effect. Now we're in the horror-territory.
* `film-noir`: Strong effect. Fatalism, dingy realism, corruption, and long inner monologues. Tends to make the protagonist male, regardless of what you put in Remember etc.
* `grim`: Strong effect. Impossible odds, grim situations. In one sample output the protagonist was fighting a horde of demons in Hell, with opening line of 'There's no two ways about it, you're dead.'
* `playful`: Strong effect. Whimsical and boisterous, with theatrical tones. Nonsensical at times, reminds me of Gulliver's Travels.
* `anomalous`: Mild effect. Adds eerie overtones, might be useful for horror-scenarios.
* `blasphemous`: Strong effect. Demonic magic, cults, etc. Nice for eldritch horror type of scenarios.
* `exploration`: Strong effect. Has nice dungeon delving mood to it, with overtones of mystery. Vivid descriptions for wilderness and abandoned places (anything from dungeons to old houses).
* `cryptic`: Mysteries abound, works much better than 'mysterious'.
* `dirge`: Strong effect. Vividly dark mood. Grim, but not completely depressing.
* `whimsical`: Commonly used style, but I still can't pinpoint exactly what it does. It seems to make things more... creative, with positive mood (reduces amount of violence, situations can usually be solved by talking, etc.)
* `quirky`: Makes output weirder. Strange events, strange characters. Good for some scenarios, but can be illogical at times.
* `surreal`: Stronger version of the above.
* `zany`: Yet another variant that makes the output more sarcastic/comedic. These have slight tone-differences; this one seems to make the narrator especially snarky.
* `chaotic`: Strong effect. Makes things zany, especially dialogue. Compared to 'surreal', this is more random.
* `esoteric`: Philosophical and spiritual focus, increased usage of obscure words. Combines especially well with styles such as 'narrative' and 'philosophical'.
* `introspective`: Decreases the amount of dialogue by making the protagonist think more.
* `pensive`: Similar to 'introspective': makes the protagonist think more. Gets very descriptive with their motivations. 
* `parody`: Mostly puns. AI is not good at humor, but it tries hard with this style.
* `reverie`: Similar to 'whimsical', with purple prose and lucid dream feel to it.
* `sonnet`: Doesn't usually follow the exact sonnet structure, but often turns the output into poetry.
* `list`: With this, the AI is more likely to stick to a list-format in the output. Useful for list-generator scenarios.
* `macabre`: Grim and grisly. Generated mostly occult horror, with frequent apocalyptic themes (zombies, undead hordes, etc.)
* `tragic`: Heavy focus on loss, heroic sacrifices and other similar themes. If there's victory to be had, it'll likely be bittersweet.
* `gritty`: Violent style, with a lot of cursing and increased amount of gore.

## Genres (these do not have much effect on the style, but instead impact the 'genre' and focus of the story):

* `medical`: Strong effect, adds medical terminology and focus to the output. Can be combined with styles such as 'quirky' for weird science. `You have a rare congenital defect that makes you unable to store glycogen in your liver, as such your body metabolizes it immediately after consumption.`
* `scientific`: Not much effect on its own, mostly just injects lab equipment (petri dishes, etc.) into the story. Stronger effect when combined with 'medical', but tends to veer into science fiction.
* `rustic`: Shifted the story focus to farming, village/rural life, that kind of things. Good for Harvest Moon style of scenarios.
* `military`: Strong effect, military fiction focus with heavy slant towards land-battles.
* `pirate`: Strong effect, makes everything pirate-focused.
* `fantastic`: Adds fantasy-elements to the story. Might be useful for keeping fantasy-scenarios on-track.
* `arcane`: Almost skipped testing this, but turns out it works. Heavily focus on magic, useful for keeping fantasy scenarios on-track.
* `investigative`: Heavy focus on detective-fiction style of narrative. Combines well with 'film-noir'.
* `grandiose`: Shifts the story focus towards high society, and makes the story more epic than usual. On the downside, this often inserts the Emperor, which then usually veers the story into WH40K territory.
* `light-hearted`: Strong good-defeats-evil focus.
* `tragic`: Heavy focus on loss, heroic sacrifices and other similar themes. If there's victory to be had, it'll likely be bittersweet.
* `Greek tragedy`: Bronze age adventures, with frequent references to Zeus, titans, etc. Does good job at pruning out modern technology, and tends to generate vivid output.

## Not recommended:

* `fast-paced`: Makes dialogue short, maybe too fast-paced.
* `amusing`: Barely noticeable, compared to 'quirky' and 'whimsical'.
* `emotive`: Strong effect, over-emotional. Tends to side-track stories.
* `confident`: Mild effect, works better as per-character trait.
* `emotional`: Mild effect, barely noticeable. 'emotive' worked better.
* `dry`: 'Dr. Doom'-style dialogue, somewhat sarcastic. Better suited for character personality traits.
* `epic`: Rarely works; Hollywood overload when it works. 'Energetic' tends to work better.
* `capricious`: Slight effect. Impulsive dialogue, works better as character trait.
* `menacing`: Weak effect. Increase in angry dialogue. Works better as character trait.
* `warm`: Mild effect. Increase in positivity... and warm weather.
* `religious`: Strong effect. Works, and does what you'd expect. Better suited for character traits.
* `egocentric`: Makes everyone egoists. Better to just use 'egoist' in character traits.
* `exhausting`: Whiny, negative dialogue. I don't see much use for this.
* `altruistic`: Heroic dialogue and actions. Better suited for character traits.
* `ambivalent`: Makes characters indecisive. Useless.
* `showy`: Makes everyone act like braggarts. Better suited for character traits.
* `epitaph`: Sometimes generates actual epitaphs, but more often than not it simply outputs 'THE END'. 'Dirge' works much better.
* `melodramatic`: Another one that works better as character traits. Using it as a style makes the output very...whiny.
* `plain-speak`: Makes sentences shorter and simpler. Might have some very marginal uses.
* `mad`: Makes the protagonist slightly insane... and everyone else too. No effect on style. Another character-trait candidate.
* `expository`: Nobody can keep secrets, and characters tend to say aloud what they're about to do. Narration focuses on past events. This doesn't seem particularly useful, though maybe it'd have some uses in lore-generation (if you reduce talkativeness by combining this with something like 'introspective'.)
* `descriptive`: Describes the locations and characters in detail, but sounds mechanical at times (like old-school interactive fiction). I'd recommend 'narrative' instead.
* `absurd`: Makes things weirder, but 'quirky' and 'surreal' had more consistent effect.
* `assertive`: No effect on the style, but makes every character confident. This is better suited for personality traits.
* `stylish`: Makes the characters wear fancy clothing, etc. No effect on writing style. Might have niche usefulness if you're making a fashion-focused scenario...

## SFW-focused:

* `happy`: Simple, childish dialogue.

## NSFW-focused:

* `sensual`: Tends to be rather explicit, not really what I'd call 'sensual'.
* `seductive`: Strong effect, makes most characters flirty. Better used as character-trait.
* `arousing`: Heavily NSFW. Makes the scenes more... descriptive.
