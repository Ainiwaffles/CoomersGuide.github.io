<h2 align="center">AI</h2>
<h3 align="center">General Questions about the AI</h3>

#### Is it possible to run AID offline?
GPT-3 can't be run on consumer hardware, it's just too demanding. Old, GPT-2 AID forks (thadunge, clover) and GodAI are still available, but they are inferior to Griffin in every way possible.

#### Does the AI know about media X?
If it existed before/during 2018–2019 and information about it could be found on the Internet, it does.
If media in question first came into existence after 2019, no, it does not.

#### Can the AI simulate my waifu perfectly?
Any simulation of a specific character will heavily rely on *fanfiction* content.
Test AI's knowledge yourself, it literally takes ~2 minutes to do.

#### Does the AI learn in real time?
No, the AI is already trained and can't learn new information.

#### Is the AI sentient?
No, you are a schizo if you think that. Do take your meds daily.

#### Is there a magic technique to get the AI to perform exactly as I want?
No, there isn't. Different people use different methods to get the desired outputs. Ultimately, how good AI is depends solely on (You)r writing.

#### Which model is used for the very first response of the story?
The same one you have chosen inside your "Settings".
Previously, GPT-2 was used for the first output of the story, that's why you may have heard about using "filler inputs". Since some undocumented update, this only applies to *completely empty prompts*. As long as you actually type anything inside that field, it won't be an issue.

#### AID doesn't work! It outputs garbage! I can't get anything good out of it!
Many of the issues with the AI's behavior can be caused by improper use of /remember & world info, high randomness, and clunky formatting/grammar.

<h3 align="center">AID Website</h3>

#### AI doesn't output naughty words, HELP!

Coomers need to manually disable Safe Mode in Settings.
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/034eue.png">
</p>

#### Is there a censorship applied to the AI even with Safe Mode turned off?
The word 'rape' (this spelling and capitalization specifically) is prevented from being generated in the outputs. Reportedly, some slurs are also filtered out.
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/pakeoh.png">
</p>

#### ALL my stories and prompts are gone! Help!
Try resetting search index inside "Account" tab in "Settings" to restore them.
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/1t34yz.png">
</p>
Remember, AI Dungeon is updated live and intermittently so always back up stories you are fond of as you MAY LOSE currently active adventures.

#### How do I back up stories? Surely there must be some kind of story/prompt export feature…
There isn't. You just "Select All" on your story/prompt, "Copy" and "Paste" it into a text file.

#### I have a problem with Android/iOS app.
Usage of the mobile app is discouraged as it is in a state of being constantly broken. Just use the mobile website instead.

<h3 align="center">Fine-tuning</h3>

#### I keep encountering Count Grey, Sir Kit, Jacob, Karth, Kyros, etc.
The model was repeatedly violated by brute-forcing it to output CYOA text. To avoid seeing them, use descriptive prose, and stop using /do and /say.

#### Can I get rid of Count Grey for good?
There is a "Banned Words List" inside "Game" tab in "Settings". It will prevent anyone from typing "svelk" in your multiplayer games AND *reduce* the amount of this word's appearances. Take note that it will not cull the words inside it *completely* from outputs. Count Grey will still lurk in the shadows…

</p>

<h3 align="center">Dragon</h3>

#### Is Dragon good?
Yes, Dragon helps and *is better* than Griffin.

#### How good is Dragon *exactly*? I think Griffin is fine and Dragon is a scam.
Dragon is 10x bigger than Griffin. It handles specific fetishes better, easier and in much more detail.
See [side-by-sides](https://files.catbox.moe/q3fbib.png) yourself: <https://catbox.moe/c/806g5o>.

#### Should I get $10 sub?
There is a free trial available for it. Try it out and see if you like it.

#### Is Platinum sub worth it? I don't want to pay $30 a month.
No, $30 tier isn't worth it unless you literally do nothing but use AID day in and day out.

#### Why is everything so expensive?! Why do I even *have* to pay for words on screen?
First, GPT-3 requires incredibly expensive hardware to run, you being able to use it for private smut generation is a blessing already.
Second, OpenAI overcharges its customers by driving their prices through the roof due to monopoly.
Third, Latitude has no clue how to run their business, bleeding money where it could be avoided.

#### I have a grandfathered $5 sub I got in July. Now, the "AI Model Type" setting has Dragon highlighted, but when I click on it, I get the notice about upgrading my plan.
It's a visual bug, you are still on Griffin. All old $5 subs are now called "Silver" and give access only to "Unlimited" Griffin. To use Dragon, you have to upgrade your plan.

<h2 align="center">Energy</h2>

#### Why is the energy bar not showing up for me? Am I on the Unlimited Dragon already?
To make your energy bar visible, toggle it in the settings menu under the "Display" tab in "Settings". It is by default hidden. Set its appearance to "numbers" too to have a concrete representation of how much you have left.
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/jfom03.png">
</p>

#### How much energy is used for a single action?
1 energy is depleted per action, BUT first 2 /retry ![](https://files.catbox.moe/p6u1jl.png) ARE free. That does not count if you /undo ![](https://files.catbox.moe/whjcco.png) and then hit enter.

#### How fast does the energy bar recharge?
Energy refills 1 unit every 5 minutes until it reaches 100 (~8 hours), then 1 per 20 minutes until it caps out at 2000 (~26 days)

<h2 align="center">AIDS</h2>

#### What are AI Dungeon Scales (AIDS) used for?
AIDS can be used to recharge energy (the only thing you should use them for), buying Worlds (read next question), and avatars.

#### Should I buy Worlds? Are they good?
Worlds are shit. AI doesn't handle massive settings well and devs don't know how to use their own tech.

#### How do I get AIDS?
* You can get a daily login bonus by clicking on a wrapped gift icon on the home page.
* People give you AIDS if they like (You) or (You)r prompt.
* If you paid for premium, each time it renews, you get a fixed amount of it, depending on your tier (100, 200, 500 respectively).

<h2 align="center">Input</h2>

<h3 align="center">General Questions about the Input</h3>

#### Why should I use /story? That is just like writing the story myself.
/do and /say garble your input, lowering the AI's output quality drastically. Also, everything /do is capable of is easily achievable with /story, along with complete control over your input.

#### Hm, but I like random outputs AI gives me when I use /do.
Write "you attempt to" to make the outcome of an action uncertain and add RNG.

#### AI forgot about my characters…
Use /remember and World Info to maintain continuity and permanence in stories.

<h3 align="center">POV and Tense</h3>

#### Out of 1st, 2nd and 3rd Person POV, which one is superior to others?
It's a personal preference.

#### But, all novels and books use 3rd Person… 2nd Person triggers bad training data, therefore, it should not be used.
If you write your scenes as an actual prose and not as a shopping list, it literally does not matter. If you are a decent writer, you can experience kino outputs no matter what Tense, POV, dialect or quotation style you are using.
Read [this question](https://rentry.co/aidg-FAQ/#is-2nd-person-3rd-1st-pov-superior-to-others) again and get better at writing.

<h2 align="center">Author's Note</h2>

#### What is Author's Note? I see people referencing it, but I can't see it anywhere?
Author's Note (A/N for short) is currently a premium only feature. HOWEVER! You can use it for free if you read the following sections.
You either click the pin or type /remember to view it.
Here is how it looks:
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/vz1mdj.png">
</p>

#### I don't understand, where is the text I put inside the A/N shown?
Text inside A/N field is injected 3 sentences above the last sentence of the output+input. It is not shown inside the main story text.
But it *is* sent to the AI and it impacts its outputs drastically.
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/fzre22.png">
</p>

#### Wow! That sounds very interesting. But I am a free user…
Kind anon made a script superseding the default A/N completely with new features. All users can use it, regardless if they know anything about programming.
Read up on it here — <https://github.com/CoomersGuide/CoomersGuide.github.io/tree/main/Resources-And-Guides/Scripts/AuthorsNote>.

<h2 align="center">A/N script</h2>

#### What does A/N script do? I don't understand.
I suggest you carefully read through the [documentation](https://github.com/CoomersGuide/CoomersGuide.github.io/tree/main/Resources-And-Guides/Scripts/AuthorsNote) again.
If you still don't understand, read the next question.

#### How do I install it?

1. You download the `scenario.zip` file from the [repo](https://github.com/CoomersGuide/CoomersGuide.github.io/blob/main/Resources-And-Guides/Scripts/AuthorsNote/scenario.zip).
DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT OFF SOMEONE ELSE!
You can rename it to something like `scenario-an.zip` so that it would not be overwritten by other scripts.
2. Go to 'My Stuff' —> 'Scenarios' —> 'Create Scenario'
3. Scroll down to 'Scripts' and click it.
4. Click the 'Upload' button ![](https://files.catbox.moe/z35hja.png).
5. Choose the file you have downloaded in the step 1.
6. (OPTIONAL) In 'Shared Library' tab (the already active one by default) there is a line:
```
state.authorsNote = "" // String for Author's Note.
```
Set something inside the quotes so that A/N will be active during the very first output (the one that happens once you click the 'Play' button ![](https://files.catbox.moe/2sf9lc.png).
Example: `state.authorsNote = "This a female sexual domination story." // String for Author's Note.`

#### I think I installed it, but how do I use it again?
You type something like:
```
/an This a high fantasy story.
The protagonist wandered for days among the ruins —
```
This will set A/N to `This a high fantasy story.` AND send `The protagonist wandered for days among the ruins —` to the AI at the same time.

#### How do I turn off the A/N display above the text input box?
Type `/anv`.

#### I can't set up Author's Note, and `/anv` does not work.
Users who reported these issues used Android app and /do mode. Use /story and web version (yes, even on the mobile).

#### Still can't get it to work.
If you are sure you followed every step correctly and it just *refuses* to work, ask in the thread about it; script's creator is active in it.

<h2 align="center">World Info</h2>

#### What is World Info (WI)?
There is a [basic guide](https://guide.aidg.club/Resources-And-Guides/WI-resources/WI-Guide.html) available for it. Read it to understand how it works.

#### Are WI keys case sensitive?
No, they are not. Capitalization is used for logical understanding of information (it just makes sense to capitalize names, regardless whether there is a difference or not).

#### Should I separate my WI keys with spaces after/before commas or not?
Spaces should be used for short or common words: `cat ,pig ,key ,`
If you do not use spaces in the above examples, words `categorical`, `pigment`, `keyboard` will trigger a WI entry.
REMINDER! The usage of such common keys is not recommended, since any mention of a cat in your story would load WI entry associated with it. Unless your story will only ever have ONE cat in it, this will confuse the AI.

#### Wait, but… I used wrong spacing for all my WI entries up until now… Should I go remake all my previous prompts?
If you styled your WI entries like this: `Emma, sister, Big Sis` the only case when WI entries would not load during usage would be a start of the paragraph.
```
Your sister¹ Emma¹ is very shy. Sister² — such a good thing to happen to you. Big Sis¹ looks after you on a daily basis.
Big Sis² loves you very much.
Emma² loves you unconditionally.
'Sister³ is such a good friend to me!' you think to yourself.
```
Here `sister¹`, `Emma¹`, `Sister²`, `Big Sis¹`, `Emma²` trigger a relevant WI entry.
`Big Sis²` and `Sister³` do not trigger a WI entry.

If you think that warrants a massive respacing of all your WI entries across all of your previous prompts, go right ahead.

#### So spaces in WI are a no go after all?
The spaces *before* commas are fine for short/common words (read [this question](https://guide.aidg.club/Resources-And-Guides/aidg%20general/aidg-FAQ.html#should-i-separate-my-wi-keys-with-spaces-afterbefore-commas-or-not) again).
Since adding a space *after* commas is grammatically correct, it was assumed that should be done for WI entries as well.
The only thing to be said about not enunciating it enough in the thread is "AID never offered much documentation". If your WI worked all this time despite this, it means it's not as much of an issue as you might think.

<h2 align="center">Formatting</h2>
   
#### Hey, if I use JSON, caveman, Zalty, Onyx, Monky, EWIJSON formatting, will AI remember and reference things better?
Don't use any programming/game formats. Write everything in normal English.

#### Why should I not use any formatting and use prose?
Short answer: they don't work. There is no evidence they help, they leak into output and once they are criticized, their proponents respond with "It feels better to me".
Long answer would require a whole separate debunking article. Once that will be written, the link to it will be here.

<h2 align="center">Guides</h2>

#### "/AIDG/ Writing Guide" and "A Coomer's Guide to AI Dungeon" contradict each other. Which one is legit?
They were written by different people during different periods of time, with each author having his own approach to AID.
Try both methods and see which one works for (You).

#### "/AIDG/ Writing Guide" is outdated. Why is it still up?
*All* information (besides GPT-2 [for the first output](https://guide.aidg.club/Resources-And-Guides/aidg%20general/aidg-FAQ.html#which-model-is-used-for-the-very-first-response-of-the-story)) inside it still holds true to this very day. The fact that it predates Author's Note does not negate its usefulness.

#### Why is HTML version just a converted PDF file?
HTML version is intended for mobile devices and browsers without the PDF viewer.

#### LaTeX is fucking garbage, you should have sticked with Markdown.
If you don't like the guide's visual look, port/change it however you want and submit a [PR](https://github.com/CoomersGuide/CoomersGuide.github.io).

#### "Minimalist" version of Coomer's Guide is not minimalist enough.
See [this question](https://guide.aidg.club/Resources-And-Guides/aidg%20general/aidg-FAQ.html#latex-is-fucking-garbage-you-should-have-sticked-with-markdown).

<h2 align="center">Latitude</h2>

#### Who is Mormon?
He is the creator of AI Dungeon 2.

#### Why do you call him that? Does he have an actual name?
Mostly out of spite for his [incompetent handling](https://render.githubusercontent.com/view/ipynb?color_mode=light&commit=5004b086af873dea0f0b05cf909e08c2e341be9d&enc_url=68747470733a2f2f7261772e67697468756275736572636f6e74656e742e636f6d2f564250584b534d492f4f70656e2d43594f41492d50726f6a6563742f353030346230383661663837336465613066306230356366393039653038633265333431626539642f4f6c645f4f70656e5f43594f41492e6970796e62&nwo=VBPXKSMI%2FOpen-CYOAI-Project&path=Old_Open_CYOAI.ipynb&repository_id=227546127&repository_type=Repository#Disclaimer-about-Nick-Walton-(original-author)) of the Colab version. Even though it's old history now, it's just a ton of fun to use that nickname.
If you actually think it's offensive and malicious, I recommend talking to actual people more, instead of lashing out at "4chan hackers".

#### Wasn't /aidg/ responsible for a DDOS attack on AID some time ago?
No, it was not. We are people interested in AID prosperity *the most*.
Any claims saying 4chan threads carry ill intent towards AID and Latitude are propaganda.
