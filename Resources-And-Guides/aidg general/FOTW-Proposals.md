* ### /fit/ Friday
   - Delicious musclegirls with fit, perfect, toned bodies glistening with sweat, obviously the superior and most based option.

* Rural and antiquity/ancient (as in Babylon and similar)
  - Ancient Friday might have too much overlap with the last theme. We'd have to stick to nonfiction to keep from just doing Folklore Friday 2. If that still works for others here I'm on board, I just worry that's how it'll be taken.
     - It's a shame that a lot of topics would have to take a back seat because of Folklore being such an overlapping topic. Stuff like deities, ancient legends, and interesting settings like Egyptian or Mesoamerican would have to wait about a month to let the fatigue out.
          - If most of us are still interested, we could ignore the overlap and just write about old stuff whether or not it's based on folklore.
* Futuristic Friday
* Femboy Friday
* Review Friday (storyposts and using others prompts)
