# Basser Lout Documentation

This directory hosts the documentation for **Basser Lout Document Formatting System** created by Jeffrey Kingston at the Basser Department of Computer Science, University of Sydney, Australia.

As it is not the most common document preparation system, it was decided to include the full documentation inside this repo, for contributors' convenience.

To get started, see "slides.pdf". Once you understood Lout's general ideas, move on to "lout-3.40-user.pdf". Expert and Design Documents are also included for reference and further study.
