## Compilation from source

1. To acquire source files, grab Source-main.pdf from the repo and extract "Source-files.zip" archive embedded inside. You need a PDF viewer with embeded files view support.
Extract all files into a new folder **AND** copy "Source-files.zip" there as well.

2. To compile, a LaTeX distribution is required. For more information, check LaTeX Project webpage https://www.latex-project.org/get/.

3. Once you have acquired your selected LaTeX distribution, you need a TeX editor. MiKTeX distribution comes bundled with TeXworks, which should be fine for most use cases. For more information, check TeX Users Group (TUG) provided list http://www.tug.org/interest.html#packages.

4. Once you have successfully compiled a PDF file, you need to convert it to HTML. For this, use pdf2htmlEX tool https://github.com/pdf2htmlEX/pdf2htmlEX.
