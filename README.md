## Compilation from source

1. Clone the repository or download "Source-files" folder.
Common files across all guides, as well as the dedicated .cls file, are located directly inside.
Actual .tex files for guides are located inside their respective subfolders.
You need to compile “*-main.tex” file for each guide.
Cover images and other media files are inside the "Media" directory.

2. To compile, a LaTeX distribution is required. For more information, check LaTeX Project webpage:
https://www.latex-project.org/get/.

3. Once you have acquired your selected LaTeX distribution, you need a TeX editor. For more information, check TeX Users Group (TUG) provided list:

4. Once you have successfully compiled a PDF file, you need to convert it to HTML. For this, use pdf2htmlEX tool:
